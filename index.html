        <p>
            I graduated from <span class="name">the Bonch-Bruevich St. Petersburg State University of
                Telecommunications</span>,
            and worked as an engineer in <span class="name">Petrozavodsk North-West Telecom</span> practically till my
            retirement.
        <p></p>
        I was retired in 2010 year, and spent several years learning German in a local group of
        people having German roots. While pandemia found out a very useful <span class="name">Video school of
            Alexei Radonets</span>, and finished everything available <p></p>
        I did like programming and in <span class="name">the former Bonch-Bruevich institute.</span>
        I learned Basic and Assembler but it was long time ago, of course.
