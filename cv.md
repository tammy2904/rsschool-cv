## About me
+ I graduated from the Bonch-Bruevich Institute of Communications, and worked as an engineer in Petrozavodsk Telegraph practically till my retirement.
+ I was retired in 2010 year, and spent several years learning German in a local group of people having German roots. While pandemia found out a very useful Video school of Alexei Radonets, and finished everything available there.
+ I do like programming and in the institute I learned Basic and Assembler but it was long time ago, of course.
